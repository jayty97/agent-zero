DreamTeam agent classes in the Agent Zero framework:

BigBrain Agent:
The BigBrain agent is a single, more advanced agent that can be called upon to handle complex tasks or provide deeper insights. It's designed to have a broader knowledge base and more sophisticated reasoning capabilities compared to the main agent.
DreamTeam Agents:
The DreamTeam consists of two specialized agents working in tandem. These agents are designed to collaborate on tasks, each bringing a unique perspective or set of skills to the problem-solving process.

Instructions for using BigBrain and DreamTeam agents:

BigBrain Agent:
a. Activation:

Type your prompt, then click the "Call BigBrain" button in the GUI, or
Type a message prefixed with "[BigBrain]" in the input field.

b. Usage:

Use BigBrain for complex queries, abstract reasoning, or when you need a more comprehensive analysis.
Example: "[BigBrain] Can you provide an in-depth analysis of the economic impacts of renewable energy adoption?"

c. Interaction:

BigBrain will process your query and provide a more detailed or insightful response compared to the main agent.
You can follow up with additional questions or requests for clarification.


DreamTeam Agents:
a. Activation:

Type your prompt, then click the "Call DreamTeam" button in the GUI, or
Type a message prefixed with "[DreamTeam]" in the input field.

b. Usage:

Use DreamTeam when you want multiple perspectives on a problem or when tackling multi-faceted issues.
Example: "[DreamTeam] What are the pros and cons of implementing a four-day work week, considering both employee well-being and business productivity?"

c. Interaction:

DreamTeam Agent 1 will first process your query and provide a response.
DreamTeam Agent 2 will then consider both your original query and Agent 1's response to provide a second, potentially complementary or contrasting perspective.
The combined response from both agents will be presented to you.
You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions or requesting further elaboration on specific points raised by either agent.



General Tips:

Be specific in your queries to get the most out of these specialized agents.
Use BigBrain when you need a single, comprehensive answer to a complex question.
Use DreamTeam when you want to explore different angles of a problem or when you need a more balanced perspective on a topic.
You can switch between using the main agent, BigBrain, and DreamTeam within the same conversation to leverage their different strengths.
Remember that while these agents have enhanced capabilities, they are still bound by the limitations of their training data and the AI models they're based on.

By utilizing BigBrain and DreamTeam agents effectively, you can tackle a wider range of problems and get more nuanced insights from the Agent Zero system. These specialized agents complement the main agent's capabilities, allowing for a more versatile and powerful AI assistant experience.
